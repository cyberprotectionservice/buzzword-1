On a stoop, a group of Puerto Ricans sits talking, drinking cerveza fr√≠o, and playing dominoes. One of their cars is parked near the stoop, and blasts salsa music. As usual we hear the rap music of Radio Raheem, but underneath the salsa music. Radio Raheem does not like to be bested; the salsa music from the parked car is giving him competition, this is no good. Radio Raheem stands in front of the stoop and raises his decibel level. The Puerto Rican men look at him, then begin to yell at him in Spanish. There is a standoff, the rap and salsa clashing in a deafening roar. One of the men, STEVIE, gets off the stoop and goes to the car. Stevie turns the car radio off. Radio Raheem smiles, nods, turns his box to a reasonable listening level, and bops down the block. Radio Raheem still the loudest. Radio Raheem still the king. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="31" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">

The men curse in Spanish and shake their heads in bewilderment and Stevie turns the salsa back on. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="31" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">
