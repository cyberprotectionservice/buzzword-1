A group of youths sit on a stoop, waiting for someone. They are CEE, PUNCHY, and the lone female, ELLA. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STOOP" scene="11" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">

The door swings open at the top of the stoop and AHMAD appears. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STOOP" scene="11" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">

In the BG, we hear the dum-dum-dum of a giant box. The sound gets louder as the box gets closer. The youths look down the block and see a tall young man coming towards them. He has a very distinct walk, it's more like a bop. This is RADIO RAHEEM. The size of his box is tremendous and one has to think, how does he carry something that big around with him? It must weigh a ton, and it seems like the sidewalk shakes as the rap music blares out. The song we hear is the only one Radio Raheem plays. Radio Raheem stops in front of the group, looks at them, and turns down the volume. It's quiet again. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STOOP" scene="11" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">
Peace, y'all. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STOOP" scene="11" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="RADIO RAHEEM" line="77">
Peace, Radio Raheem. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STOOP" scene="11" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="ELLA" line="78">
Peace. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STOOP" scene="11" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="CEE" line="79">
You the man, Radio Raheem. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STOOP" scene="11" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="PUNCHY" line="80">
It's your world. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STOOP" scene="11" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="AHMAD" line="81">
In a big way. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STOOP" scene="11" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="CEE" line="82">
Radio Raheem nods and turns up the volume. Way up. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STOOP" scene="11" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">
My people. My people. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STOOP" scene="11" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="AHMAD" line="83">
