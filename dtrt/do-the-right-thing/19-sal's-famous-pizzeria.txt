Customers are in Sal's; it's lunchtime and it's fairly busy. Sal puts a hot slice down on the counter in front of BUGGIN' OUT, a b-boy. <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="19" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">

Buggin' Out slams his money down on the counter, takes his slice and sits down. All around Buggin' Out, peering down from the WALL OF FAME, are signed, framed, eight by ten glossies of famous Italian Americans. WE SEE Joe DiMaggio, Rocky Marciano, Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, Luciano Pavarotti, Liza Minnelli, Governor Mario Cuomo, Al Pacino and, of course, how can we forget Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa: THE ITALIAN STALLION, also RAMBO. He looks at the pictures hovering above him. <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="19" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">

Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks.
