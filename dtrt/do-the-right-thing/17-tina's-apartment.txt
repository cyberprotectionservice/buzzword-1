Hector, I shouldn't be telling you this but you would find out sooner or later. Ya father ain't no real father. He's a bum, a two-bit bum in a hundred-dollar world. Your father is to the curb. You're smart. I see that look on ya face. You're saying if he's such a bum why am I with him? Good question. Like I said before, you're no dummy. He talked his way into my panties, I thought being a mother would make me happy, make me whole. He's a mistake, but you are not. <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="TINA'S APARTMENT" scene="17" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="TINA" line="97">
