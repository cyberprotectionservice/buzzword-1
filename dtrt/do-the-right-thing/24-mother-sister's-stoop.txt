She looks up at the white-hot sun. She does the same. Right now, folks, we're gonna suspend the narrative and show how people are coping with the oppressive heat. People are taking cold showers. Sticking faces in ice-cold, water-filled sinks. Heads stuck in refrigerators. A wife tells her husband, "Hell no, I'm not cooking. It's too hot. The kitchen is closed." Men downing six-packs of ice-cold brew. Faces stuck directly in front of fans. A young kid cracks an egg on Sal's Cadillac. The moment the egg hits the car hood it starts to cook. The kid looks directly INTO THE CAMERA and smiles, then looks up to see Sal, mad as a motherfucker, chasing after him. And how can I forget the papers, the newspaper headlines. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="MOTHER SISTER'S STOOP" scene="24" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">
