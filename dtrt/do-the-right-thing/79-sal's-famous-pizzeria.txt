Vito, Pino and Mookie are cleaning up. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">
Sal, it's almost quitting time so please start counting my pay. I gotta get paid. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="MOOKIE" line="700">
Sal is looking into the cash register. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">
We did good business today. We got a good thing going. Nothing like a family in business working together. One day the both of you will take over...and Mookie, there will always be a place for you at Sal's Famous Pizzeria. Y'know, it should be Sal's and Sons Famous Pizzeria. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="SAL" line="701">
All three look at each other. The horror is on their faces, with the prospect of working, slaving in Sal's and Sons Famous Pizzeria, trapped for the rest of their lives. Is this their future? It's a frightening thought. Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella enter. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">
We're about to close. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="SAL" line="702">
Just four slices, regular slices. Please. To go! <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="AHMAD" line="703">
OK, but that's it. It's been a long day. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="SAL" line="704">
Mookie goes over to the table where Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella sit. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">
Look, I want you to get your slices, then outta here. No playing around. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="MOOKIE" line="705">
You got it. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="AHMAD" line="706">
Good. No joke. We all wanna go home. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="MOOKIE" line="707">
OH NO! We hear the dum-dum-dum of Radio Raheem's box. As everyone turns their heads to the door, Buggin' Out and Radio Raheem are inside already. We have never heard the rap music as loud as it is now. You have to scream to be heard and that's what they do. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">
What did I tell ya 'bout dat noise? <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="SAL" line="708">
What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures? <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="BUGGIN' OUT" line="709">
What da fuck! Are you deaf? <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="SAL" line="710">
No, are you? We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="BUGGIN' OUT" line="711">
Turn that JUNGLE MUSIC off. We ain't in Africa. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="SAL" line="712">
Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella start to dance while Mookie takes a seat, the impartial observer that he is. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">
Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa? <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="BUGGIN' OUT" line="713">
It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="SAL" line="714">
Radio Raheem. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="PINO" line="715">
Fuck you. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="RADIO RAHEEM" line="716">
What ever happened to nice music with words you can understand? <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="SAL" line="717">
This is music. My music. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="RADIO RAHEEM" line="718">
We're closed. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="VITO" line="719">
You're closed alright, till you get some Black people up on that wall. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="BUGGIN' OUT" line="720">
Sal grabs his Mickey Mantle bat from underneath the counter and brings it down on Radio Raheem's box, again and again and again. The music stops. Radio Raheem's pride and joy is smashed to smithereens. It's going to the junkyard quick. There is an eerie quiet as everyone is frozen, surprised by the suddenness of Sal's action, the swings of his Mickey Mantle bat. All look at Radio Raheem and realize what is about to happen. Radio Raheem screams, he goes crazy. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">

Radio Raheem picks Sal up from behind the counter and starts to choke his ass. Radio Raheem's prized possession--his box, the only thing he owned of value--his box, the one thing that gave him any sense of worth--has been smashed to bits. (Radio Raheem, like many Black youth, is the victim of materialism and a misplaced sense of values.) Now he doesn't give a fuck anymore. He's gonna make Sal pay with his life. Vito and Pino jump on Radio Raheem, who only tightens his grip around Sal's neck. Buggin' Out tries to help his friend. Mookie just stands and watches as Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella cheerlead. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="79" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">
