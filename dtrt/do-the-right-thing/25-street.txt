POW! A powerful gush of water flies out RIGHT AT THE CAMERA. Ahmad has just turned on the johnny pump and the white stream of water flies across the street. This attracts all the people of the block. It's a chance to cool off and momentarily beat the killer heat. They both scrape beer cans on the sidewalk. She stands with caution away from the fire hydrant. Ella does not want to get wet. They're still scraping away. Folks, young and old, begin to get in the water and play. Both now have cans with the ends scraped away, and go to the johnny pump. Punchy bends down behind the hydrant and places the can over the water. The can now directs the water into giant streams. Ahmad sneaks up behind Ella and picks her up. She's kicking and screaming furiously. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="25" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">

Ahmad! Put me down! Put me down! I can't get wet! I'm not playing! <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="25" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="ELLA" line="178">
Ahmad is not having it. He carries a kicking Ella into the middle of the street in direct line of fire. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="25" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">
Yo! <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="25" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="AHMAD" line="179">
No! <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="25" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="ELLA" line="180">
They both are hit with a blast of water and are soaked to the bone. Ella starts to punch Ahmad, and chases after him. We hear the familiar rap music of Radio Raheem's box. Radio Raheem is too cool. By the way he's dressed, it could be fall, not the hottest day of the year. But you could never tell it from him. He's too cool. Raheem looks at Cee, he wants to get by and he doesn't want to get wet either. And if his box gets wet, somebody is gonna die. Cee knows this too. Cee stands in front of the hydrant, blocking the water so Radio Raheem can pass. He slowly bops across the street as all eyes watch. When he's clear, Cee moves and the water gushes out again as folks play. We hear a car horn blowing. People move out of the way as the vehicle speeds through the spray. An older man, CHARLIE, stops his white convertible and blows his horn. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="25" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">
I'm not playing. There's gonna be trouble if you fuck around. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="25" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="CHARLIE" line="181">
Go 'head. You got it. You got it. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="25" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="PUNCHY" line="182">

Both Punchy and Cee sit in front of the hydrant once again, blocking the water. The car cautiously eases forward. Charlie doesn't trust Cee and Punchy at all. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="25" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">
I'm warning you. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="25" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="CHARLIE" line="185">
C'mon. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="25" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="PUNCHY" line="186">
Hurry up. We ain't got all day. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="25" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="CEE" line="187">
The people all move to the car, for they know what is about to happen. Cee and Punchy leap off the hydrant, unleashing a jet blast that flies directly into Charlie's car. The whole block is dying. Charlie pulls his flooded car over to the curb, jumps out, and runs to get hold of Cee and Punchy. Of course, he's slow, as the kids turn into track stars and make like Carl Lewis. Charlie, a wet mess, tries to buy some sympathy from the folks; none is to be bought. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="25" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">
I'm fucking soaked. If I ever catch those fucks they'll be sorry. Cocksucking sonabitches! <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="25" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="CHARLIE" line="188">
The ranting continues, and people laugh at him. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="25" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">
You people make me sick. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="25" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="CHARLIE" line="189">

Officer Long goes into his car and gets a wrench. Officer Long turns off the hydrant, then puts the cap back on. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="25" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">
This hydrant better not come back on or there's gonna be hell to pay. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="25" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="OFFICER PONTE" line="197">
