THE BLOCK. WE'VE SEEN it at daytime, but now WE SEE it at night. Even though the white-hot sun is gone, nonetheless the heat is still stifling. And in a peculiar, funny sort of way, it's worse. You expect it to be hot during the light of day when the sun is beating down on the cement and tar, but at night it should be considerably cooler; well, not tonight, it's hot. All the residents of The Block: the Corner Men, Mother Sister, Da Mayor, Jade, etc., all the people WE'VE SEEN throughout the day are now coping with the night-time heat, plus it's humid as shit. Everyone is outside, sitting on stoops, on cars and you know the kids are playing, running up and down the block. Now it's the hottest night of the year. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="STOREROOM" scene="77" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">
