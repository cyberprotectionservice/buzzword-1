It's so nice to see a family hanging out together. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="BUGGIN' OUT" line="457">
We're not hanging out. I'm being escorted back to work. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="MOOKIE" line="458">
That's not even true. I just want a slice. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="JADE" line="459">
Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="BUGGIN' OUT" line="460">
What did he do this time? <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="JADE" line="461">
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame? <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="BUGGIN' OUT" line="462">
So? <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="JADE" line="463">
Have you noticed something about them? <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="BUGGIN' OUT" line="464">
No. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="JADE" line="465">
Yo, I'm gone. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="MOOKIE" line="466">
I'll see ya there. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="JADE" line="467">
Peace. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="BUGGIN' OUT" line="468">
Mookie leaves. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">
Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="BUGGIN' OUT" line="469">
And? <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="JADE" line="470">
And I--we--want some Black people up. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="BUGGIN' OUT" line="471">
Did you ask Sal? <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="JADE" line="472">
Yeah, I asked him. I don't want nobody in there, nobody spending good money in Sal's. He should get no mo' money from the community till he puts some Black faces up on that motherfucking wall. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="BUGGIN' OUT" line="473">
Jade looks at Buggin' Out like "Are you serious?" <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">
Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="JADE" line="474">
So, in other words, you are not down. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="BUGGIN' OUT" line="475">
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="JADE" line="476">
Jade, I still love you. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="BUGGIN' OUT" line="477">
I still love you too. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="58" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="JADE" line="478">
