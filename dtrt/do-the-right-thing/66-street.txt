An old Puerto Rican man rings a bell as he pushes a cart on wheels. On the side of the cart is hand-lettered HELADO DE COCO, and a big block of ice rests on top surrounded by different colored bottles of flavors. A group of kids eagerly waits for the ices. The man scrapes the block of ice, puts the shavings in a paper cup, and drowns it with syrup. Da Mayor is walking down the street. We hear the familiar tune from the Mister Softee truck as it comes down the street. Eddie, the young kid who earlier ran an errand for Da Mayor, looks up from the sidewalk where he's playing and runs out into the street in pursuit of Mister Softee. <metadata time="DUSK" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="66" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">

A woman in her twenties, LOUISE, Eddie's mother, breaks through the crowd and hugs her baby. <metadata time="DUSK" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="66" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">
What's wrong? <metadata time="DUSK" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="66" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="LOUISE" line="533">

Ma'am, the boy is just scared to death. What actually happened is that I was minding my business when I saw your son about to be run over.

You're right. <metadata time="DUSK" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="66" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction" speaker="DA MAYOR" line="548">
Louise goes away, probably to give her son another "whooping." Da Mayor tips his hat to her. <metadata time="DUSK" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="66" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">
